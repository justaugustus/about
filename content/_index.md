Stephen is a Black engineering director and community leader in open source,
based in New York City.

Most recently, he was Head of Open Source at Cisco, where he founded the Open
Source Program Office (OSPO) and managed a team of brilliant architects.

Stephen currently participates in project-level steering committees
([Kubernetes][k8s], [OpenSSF Scorecard][scorecard], [TODO Group][todo]) and
helps maintain a few codebases around open source projects you may have heard of.

Additionally, he serves as an advisor and investor for startups in the open
source ecosystem.

Within the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), he maintains OpenSSF
Scorecard, a project that helps assess the security posture of open source
projects.

For [Kubernetes][k8s], Stephen serves as a [Steering Committee][k8s-steering]
member and a chair of [SIG Release][sig-release].
He has co-founded transformational elements of the project, including the
[KEP][enhancements] (Kubernetes Enhancements Proposal) process, the
[Release Engineering][releng] subproject, and Working Group Naming. He has
previously served as a chair of both SIG PM and SIG Azure.

Across the wider Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([CNCF][cncf]) ecosystem, he
is a former [TAG Contributor Strategy][contrib-strat] Chair, [Dex][dex]
maintainer, and Program Chair for [KubeCon / CloudNativeCon][kubecon], the
cloud native community's flagship conference.

Stephen is a [prolific contributor][devstats] to CNCF projects, and is amongst
the top 100 (as of writing) code/content committers since the inception of the
foundation.

In 2020, Stephen co-founded the [Inclusive Naming Initiative][ini], a
cross-industry group dedicated to helping projects and companies make
consistent, responsible choices to remove harmful language across codebases,
standards, and documentation.

He has previously held positions at Cisco, VMware (via Heptio), Red Hat, and
CoreOS. He has also participated in foundation-level governing boards
([OpenSSF][ossf], [CNCF][cncf], [OpenAPI Initiative][oapi]).
