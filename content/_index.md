(as of writing) code/content committers, all-time.

In 2020, Stephen co-founded the [Inclusive Naming Initiative][ini], a
cross-industry group dedicated to helping projects and companies make
consistent, responsible choices to remove harmful language across codebases,
standards, and documentation. He leads the Community/Open Source workstream
and maintains the initiative's infrastructure.

He has previously held positions at VMWare (via Heptio), Red Hat, and CoreOS.
